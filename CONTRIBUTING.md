## Issue Reports

If you are at all unsure whether it's a bug in OpenELEC or a problem with something
else, post in the Forum instead. If it turns out that it is a bug, a issue
can always bee open later.

If you are sure that it's a bug in OpenELEC, open a new [issue] and try to
answer the following questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?

Please also post steps to reproduce. Ideally a failing test would be
perfect, but even a simple demonstration of the error would suffice.
Please don't paste logs in issues reports or issue comments use pastebinit instead

It is always good to provide the zip file found in the logfiles samba share.

Make sure to specify which version of OpenELEC you are using.
- Version
- Build
- Arch

Feature requests are great, but they usually end up lying around the issue
tracker indefinitely. Sending a pull request is a much better way of getting a
particular feature into OpenELEC.

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Create topic branches**. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history**. Make sure each individual commit in your pull
  request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while
  developing, please squash them before sending them to us.
